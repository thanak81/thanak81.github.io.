            <h2 id="overview" class="head">Overview</h2>
            <p>Physical health and mental health are strongly connected. Taking care of your physical health is scientifically shown to improve mental wellbeing, and vice versa. If one declines, the other can be affected too.
            <p> A balanced diet, proper sleep, and cutting down unhealthy habits such as smoking, alcohol, and drugs are some of the key physical health factors that can promote mental wellbeing. Some of the things that can affect mental wellbeing are stress, working too much, and being too inactive.</p>
            <p>Studies are showing more and more that a holistic approach to health – linking physical, social, emotional, and mental health – is necessary for mental wellbeing. This approach also helps a great deal with managing and recovering from mental illness.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exercise may block negative thoughts or distract you from daily worries.</li>
                    <li>Exercising with others provides an opportunity for increased social contact.</li>
                    <li>Increased fitness may lift your mood and improve your sleep patterns. </li>
                    <li>Exercise may also change levels of chemicals in your brain, such as serotonin, endorphins and stress hormones.</li>

                <li id="hydration" class="physical-head">Hydration</li>
                <p>Hydration plays a crucial role in Physical and Mental Health.</p>
                <h3 class="quality">How important is Water & Hydration?</h3>
                <p>-> Some of us go days, weeks or more without drinking any straight water, but get it in lesser amounts from other sources, such as coffee, sodas, or other drinks, and some foods, most notably fruits, vegetables and clear soups. Since at least half of the composition of the human body is water, and every cell depends on it, that can’t be great for our physical health.</p>
                <p> It is recommends for adult to drink atleast 3L of water everyday to give your body the hydration that they are looking for.</p>
                <h3 class="quality">Benefit of Hydration :</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Helps maximize physical performance</li>
                    <p>If you don’t stay hydrated, your physical performance can suffer.</p>
                    <p>Dehydration can have a noticeable effect if you lose as little as 2% of your body’s water content. However, it isn’t uncommon for athletes to lose as much as 6–10% of their water weight via sweat.</p>
                    <p>This can lead to altered body temperature control, reduced motivation, and increased fatigue. It can also make exercise feel much more difficult, both physically and mentally.</p>
                    <p>Optimal hydration has been shown to prevent this from happening, and it may even reduce the oxidative stress that occurs during high intensity exercise. This isn’t surprising when you consider that muscle is about 80% water</p>
                    <p>If you exercise intensely and tend to sweat, staying hydrated can help you perform at your absolute best.</p>
                    <li>Improved brain performance</li>
                    <p>Even mild dehydration—as little as 2% fluid loss—can affect memory, mood, concentration, and reaction time. Adding just a few glasses of water to your daily intake can have a positive effect on cognition, stabilize your emotions, and even combat feelings of anxiety. This is especially important for older adults who are at higher risk for both dehydration and impaired cognitive function.</p>
                    <li>Kidney stone prevention</li>
                    <p>Kidney stones are clumps of mineral crystals that form in the urinary tract. If you've ever experienced one, you know how painful they can be. Consuming adequate amounts of water each day can help dilute the concentration of minerals in your urinary tract and make stones less likely. Water also helps flush harmful bacteria from your bladder and can aid in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs).</p>
                    <li>Improved detoxification</li>
                    <p>Sufficient water intake supports your body’s natural detoxification systems, which remove waste and harmful substances through urination, breathing, perspiration, and bowel movements. Supporting your own powerful, built-in detox processes can help enhance your overall health.</p>
