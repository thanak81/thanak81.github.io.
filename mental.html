        <p>Beyond everything else we’ve already discussed, being mentally healthy can significantly impact our psychological, emotional, and social well-being. It directly affects how we feel and act on a daily basis. Mental health is a major factor when we make difficult choices, deal with stress, and relate to other people in our world.</p>
        <p>Yet, mental health isn’t just something we can deal with once and then get over. It’s important in every stage of our life. From infancy all the way into adulthood — mental health is something we need to be cognizant of and handle with care.</p>
        <h2 id="awareness">Why Should We Spread Mental Health Awareness?</h2>
        <p>By making a concerted effort to spread mental health awareness, we can work to de-stigmatize how we think about, approach, and identify mental health issues in our society. </p>
        <img class="mental_image" src="mentalaware.webp" alt="">
        <p>Having those tough conversations and admitting there’s a problem means we can come up with a solution. We can start removing the shame and fear that’s often associated with topics surrounding mental health. Doing so can increase the likelihood of someone reaching out when they need help. </p>
        <p>Asking for help is a sign of strength. Working together allows us to begin building a foundation that respects and honors the importance of good mental health.</p>
        <p>Another benefit to focusing on mental health awareness is that it can make signs and symptoms of certain conditions more well-known. Early intervention is predictive of how successful mental health treatment will be for many conditions. The earlier someone is diagnosed and begins treatment, the more likely it is that they’ll be able to manage their condition and improve their mental health.</p>
